# get '/restaurant/:id' do

# For instance, we could set up a route that returns a specific Game from the games table, formatted as JSON, using very similar code to what we used above:

# get '/games/:id' do
#   game = Game.find(params[:id])
#   game.to_json
# end


# Controller is the go-between for the model and the view. interacts with the model so it can send our response to the frontend
